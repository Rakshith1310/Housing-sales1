# Projects
1. The first project contains the project which I had done through Courseera, which a gave me a broad idea of analysing the data. Here I have analysed and plotted graphs to get 
the price of the housing sales.

2. Second project is a linear regression problem, wherein I have predicted the per-capita income of the country Canada with the previous yeras data. This has only one input to 
predict the future per-capita income of the country.

3. This is a spam-ham detector, which detects whether a given message or text might be a spam message or from an authenticated user/source. This uses NLTK's naivebayesclassifier 
to do so. This is a supervised project as I had the collected the previous records of spam messages, using this and by NLTK's library data has been trained. Accuracy is above 95%.
