# Projects
1. Data_analytics_project 
    -The first project contains the project which I had done through Courseera, which a gave me a broad idea of analysing the data. Here I have analysed and plotted graphs to get 
the price of the housing sales.

2. Linearregression
  -Second project is a linear regression problem, wherein I have predicted the per-capita income of the country Canada with the previous yeras data. This has only one input to 
predict the future per-capita income of the country.

3. Spam-hamd_detector
  -This is a spam-ham detector, which detects whether a given message or text might be a spam message or from an authenticated user/source. This uses NLTK's naivebayesclassifier 
to do so. This is a supervised project as I had the collected the previous records of spam messages, using this and by NLTK's library data has been trained. Accuracy is above 95%.

4. Multivariate_Linearregression
  -A project on predicting a feature(salary) based on more than 1 feature. It predicts salary based on the employee's interview_score, test_score and with the prior experience. This is a supervised learning project. Here I have also used "w2n.word_to_number" on a particular feature to convert text form of a number to the integer format, it was fun learning:).

5. Movie_recommendation system
  -Basic project on ML which recommends movies on the basis of their genres, cast, director, keywords such as movie description etc. Here I used cosine similarity to convert text into the floating point numbers and to gain similarity between the features extracted. More features can be used to have robust output.
