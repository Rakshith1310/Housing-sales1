# Projects
1. Data_analytics_project 
    -The first project contains the project which I had done through Courseera, which a gave me a broad idea of analysing the data. Here I have analysed and plotted graphs to get 
the price of the housing sales.

2. Linearregression
  -Second project is a linear regression problem, wherein I have predicted the per-capita income of the country Canada with the previous yeras data. This has only one input to 
predict the future per-capita income of the country.

3. Spam-hamd_detector
  -This is a spam-ham detector, which detects whether a given message or text might be a spam message or from an authenticated user/source. This uses NLTK's naivebayesclassifier 
to do so. This is a supervised project as I had the collected the previous records of spam messages, using this and by NLTK's library data has been trained. Accuracy is above 95%.

4. Multivariate_Linearregression
  -A project on predicting a feature(salary) based on more than 1 feature. It predicts salary based on the employee's interview_score, test_score and with the prior experience. This is a supervised learning project. Here I have also used "w2n.word_to_number" on a particular feature to convert text form of a number to the integer format, it was fun learning:).

5. Movie_recommendation system
  -Basic project on ML which recommends movies on the basis of their genres, cast, director, keywords such as movie description etc. Here I used cosine similarity to convert text into the floating point numbers and to gain similarity between the features extracted. More features can be used to have robust output.
  
  6. Bengaluru Home price Analysis
    -This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate price prediction website. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html, css and javascript that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, etc.
